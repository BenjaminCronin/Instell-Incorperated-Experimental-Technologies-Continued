## This mod requires Firespitter, which is not mine, and which is not included. You can get it off of http://snjo.github.io/ and choose the plugin selection to automagicly download the .dll.   
* Place the plugin in the GameData folder, no internal folder necessary. Make sure you have the latest version and that there are no other Firespitter plugins in your GameData folder.
